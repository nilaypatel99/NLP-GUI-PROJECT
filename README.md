# oop-project
Developed Python-based GUI application for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and Tkinter for the interface. The project also integrates NLP models and utilizes external APIs for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), Emotion Detection, and Sentiment Analysis.

Here's a summary of the project description, breaking it down into the key components:

Project Overview:

- Technology Stack:
  - Programming Language: Python
  - GUI Framework: Tkinter (for creating the graphical user interface)
  - NLP Tasks: Named Entity Recognition, Emotion Detection, Sentiment Analysis
  - OOP Principles: Object-Oriented Programming (to structure the code in classes and objects)
  - External APIs: NLP Playground APIs (to access pre-trained NLP models)

### Core Features:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   - Built using Tkinter, the GUI allows users to interact with the NLP tasks.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting text and displaying results of various NLP analyses.

2. NLP Tasks:
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER): The system identifies and classifies entities such as names, dates, organizations, and more from the input text.
   - Emotion Detection: The system analyzes the text and detects the emotional tone or sentiment behind it (e.g., joy, anger, sadness).
   - Sentiment Analysis: The system determines whether the input text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

3. OOP Structure:
   - Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles (e.g., classes, inheritance, polymorphism) to organize and structure the code, making it modular and maintainable.

4. NLP Playground APIs:
   - The application integrates with NLP Playground APIs to leverage advanced pre-trained NLP models for tasks like NER, emotion detection, and sentiment analysis. These APIs can be used to send textual data and retrieve results from the models.

### Sample Workflow:

1. User Input: The user enters text into the GUI.
2. Processing: The text is sent to the corresponding NLP models through the NLP Playground APIs.
3. Results Displayed:
   - The Named Entities are shown in a list or on the interface.
   - The detected emotion or sentiment is displayed as part of the analysis results.

### Benefits of the Project:
- The use of Tkinter ensures that the application is accessible to users who may not be familiar with coding or command-line interfaces.
- OOP principles allow for cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones in the future.
- API integration makes it easier to leverage powerful NLP models without needing to build them from scratch, saving time and effort in model training and fine-tuning.
